#Code Book

##This document describe the R code provided

The code is split in the 5 parts that are required

The Files present

* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used
* 'features.txt': features list
* 'activity_labels.txt': activity names and their code
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Identifies each person who did the activity
* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
